# Paco

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/paco.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/paco)

Paco is a parser combinator library inspired by Haskell's [Parsec] and [Parsimmon].

"But I don't need to write another JSON parser or a new language, why do I need your library then?"

Well, most probably you don't. But I can think of rare cases when you do. Say, you need to write a validation for [git branch names].

You can go with easy-peasy regex:

```ruby
branch_name_regex = /^(?!\/|.*(?:[\/.]\.|\/\/|@{|\\|\.lock$|[\/.]$))[^\040\177 ~^:?*\[]+$/

branch_name_regex.match?("feature/branch-validation")
```

With Paco, you can go with a little more verbose version of that rule:

```ruby
module BranchNameParser
  extend Paco

  class << self
    def parse(input)
      parser.parse(input)
    end

    def parser
      lookahead(none_of("/")).next(valid_chars.join)
    end

    def valid_chars
      any_char.not_followed_by(invalid_sequences).at_least(1)
    end
    
    def invalid_sequences
      alt(invalid_chars, invalid_endings)
    end

    def invalid_chars
      alt(
        string("/."),
        string(".."),
        string("//"),
        string("@{"),
        string("\\\\"),
        one_of("\040\177 ~^:?*\\[")
      )
    end

    def invalid_endings
      seq(
        alt(string(".lock"), one_of("/.")),
        eof
      )
    end
  end
end

BranchNameParser.parse("feature/branch-validation")
```

Easy? Not really, but there is a chance you can read it. ðŸ˜…
